How to run:

we use vscode to run this server

install node.js
install SQLite extension


while in the same folder as app.js, in the terminal type:
npm init -y

then type:
npm install express body-parser sqlite3 ejs

in the app.js file, uncomment the 2darray 'list', and the for loop under it

to start the server, in the terminal type:
node app.js

after this, the 2darray list and the for loop can be recommented, since they are only needed to initialize the db
